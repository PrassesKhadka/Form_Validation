    <title>Form Validation Using JS->Constraint Validation API</title>

    <!--Browser form ->Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and 
        Password Confirmation-> use live inline validation 
        to inform the user whether a field is properly 
        filled in or not. That means highlighting
        a field red and providing a helpful error message
        until it has been filled in properly. -->

    <!-- The form doesn’t need to actually submit, but you should give an error message 
        if the button is pushed with any active errors or unfilled required fields.
        For the sake of this lesson, make sure all of the validation occurs in 
        the JavaScript file. If all is well and the form is “submitted”,
        give the user a high five. -->
